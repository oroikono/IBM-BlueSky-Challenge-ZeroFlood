# IBM BlueSky Challenge - ZeroFlood

The üåç **ZeroFlood** is a smart, resource-efficient tool for predicting flood risk in data-scarce environments. It leverages satellite imagery and a Geo-Foundation Model with a Chain-of-Thought reasoning process to accurately identify flood-prone areas, even when high-quality geospatial data is unavailable. The tool is designed to be accessible, affordable, and scalable, making it valuable for enhancing flood resilience in underserved and vulnerable communities.
